# Understanding Modulo in Python



# Story
# Joe works at an apple farm and he uses his net to carry apples. 
# Joe is paid when his net is full of apples.
# The variable a stands for the number of apples available.
# The variable n stands for the number of apples his net can hold.
# Use the modulo equation to determine how many apples remain.

# Example A
a = 5
n = 2
print ("The answer to Example A is ", a % n)

# Example B
a = 5
n = 3
print ("The answer to Example B is ", a % n)

# Example C
a = 10
n = 3
print ("The answer to Example C is ", a % n)

# Example D
a = 9
n = 3
print ("The answer to Example D is ", a % n)

# Example E
a = 3
n = 0
#print ("The answer to Example E is Zero Division Error")
# This will create an error feel free to remove the hash from the next line.
#print ("The answer to Example E is ", a % n)

# Example F
a = 2
n = 10
print ("The answer to Example F is ", a % n)

#a=28
#b=5
#mod=a-((a//b)*b)
#print("mod=",{mod})
#print(a%b)
